## Bitcoin Token Telegram Bot

The Bitcoin Token Telegram Bot is a great way to introduce some response automation for your Telegram group. This application is built using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) framework and the [Botman](https://botman.io) library. Database support was added as a way to allow multiple team members to update the bot's response content. You will need a database in order to use this, which could be as simple as SQLite or as complex as MySQL.
